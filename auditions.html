          <h2 class="top-text">Lashkara is back for another season, and we want you to join our family!</h2>
          <h2 class="general-text">✶✶✶ NO DANCE EXPERIENCE NECESSARY ✶✶✶</h2>
          <h2 class="general-text">Over the 2016-2017 season, we proved ourselves to be one of the top teams in the nation by placing 3rd at the most prestigious Bollywood Fusion competition in the world: Bollywood America. We have come so far, but this is only the beginning!</h2>
          <h2 class="general-text">Ask anyone who has been on this team, or is currently on this team, and they will tell you that Lashkara is more than just a dance team - we are a family. By being on this family, you get to network with people all over the country, travel the world, attain a support system that will never leave your side, all while doing what we love the most: performing and telling a story through dance.</h2>
          <img src="photos/LashkaraWorkshops.jpeg" alt="workshops" class="workshops"/>
          <h2 class="general-text">This coming October, we will be hosting our annual workshops and tryouts! At workshops, the captains will teach you a short routine that is under a minute. Whether you are trained in dance, or have never set foot into a dance studio, this is the perfect chance for you to meet new people, try something new, or even just get some exercise! At workshops, we will also have a Q &amp; A session where we will answer any questions you have about being on the team.</h2>
          <img src="photos/Meet.png" alt="meet" class="workshops"/>
          <h2 class="general-text">If you decide to audition, we will have auditions the following few days. Captains are NOT looking for perfection - we are looking for dancers who are having fun, showing passion &amp; energy, and take critique and implement it. We do not expect the routine to be 100% perfect. Don't let stage fright get to you! We don't bite, and we hope to make the entire audition experience fun for everyone who attends!</h2>
          <h2 class="general-text">We're geared up for this year: now all we need is YOU! :) We’re so excited to see you all so soon and start the Lashkara 7.0 journey!</h2>
